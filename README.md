# Extracting Wage Information from Unstructured Job Postings
## Purpose
This project aims to extract wage information from the unstructured text of job postings to study the impact of Coloradoâ€™s pay transparency law on patterns of wage disclosure. The job posting data used in this project is provided by [LinkUp](https://www.linkup.com/), a leading data provider that sources job postings from company websites.

## Approach
I use a three-step approach for wage extraction: 

1. Isolating Text Segments Containing Wage Data
2. Fine-Tuning a Question-Answering Transformer Model
3. Extracting and Categorizing Wage Figures Using Regular Expressions

## Evaluation
The finetuned model significantly outperforms the base model, achieving an exact match rate of 88.05% and an F1 score of 93.76%, compared to the original rates of 54.08% and 66.39%, respectively.

## Further Insights
The findings and analyses using the extracted wage data are available in the working paper "Pay Transparency and Gender Differences in Job Search" at https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4984519.
