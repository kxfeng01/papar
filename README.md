# Extracting Wage Information from Unstructured Job Postings
## Purpose
This project aims to extract wage information from the unstructured text of job postings to study the impact of Coloradoâ€™s pay transparency law on patterns of wage disclosure. The job posting data used in this project is provided by [LinkUp](https://www.linkup.com/), a leading data provider that sources job postings from company websites.

## Approach
I use a three-step approach for wage extraction: 

1. Isolating Text Segments Containing Wage Data
2. Fine-Tuning a Question-Answering Transformer Model
3. Extracting and Categorizing Wage Figures Using Regular Expressions

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Limited access to large LLMs**
    * Challenge: As a student, I did not have the computing resources or funding to use commercial LLMs.
    * Approach: I chose **smaller, open-source transformers** that could be fine-tuned on university machines.
2. **Unstructured job posting text**
    * Challenge: Salary details were buried in a variety of unstructured text (hourly rates, annual salaries, ranges, etc.).
    * Approach: I **filtered chunks of text** likely to contain wage information, such as those with a dollar sign followed by digits (e.g., $12, $9, $52,000), from job descriptions.
3. **Data Annotation and Fine-Tuning**
    * Challenge: Manually labeling wage snippets is time-consuming and error-prone.
    * Approach: I used **semi-automatic labeling** by first using a **pre-trained transform model** to identify likely wage snippets, then manually correcting them to construct a high-quality training set.
4. **Diverse wage formats**
    * Challenge: Wage data appeared in multiple formats - hourly, annual, ranges.
    * Approach: I used **regular expressions** to parse numeric patterns and pay frequency indicators, categorized wages by pay frequency (hourly/monthly/biweekly/annually), and annualized the extracted numbers.
5. **Hardware and computational limitations**
    * Challenge: With a dataset of over 1 billion records, running predictions on a single machine was slow - it would take several days.
    * Approach: I **split the dataset** into smaller portions and **ran them in parallel** on multiple processes, which took only a few hours to complete.

## Model Evaluation
The finetuned model significantly outperforms the base model, achieving an exact match rate of **88.05%** and an F1 score of **93.76%**, compared to the original rates of 54.08% and 66.39%, respectively.

## Further Insights
The findings and analyses using the extracted wage data are available in the working paper "Pay Transparency and Gender Differences in Job Search" at https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4984519.
