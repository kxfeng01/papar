    "# Extracting wages from unstructured job postings using transformer\n",
    "Author: Kexin Feng\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to extract wage information from unstructured job postings. The job posting data is from [LinkUp](https://www.linkup.com/), a platform that aggregates job listings directly from company websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use a three-step approach for wage extraction: \n",

    "2. **Fine-Tuning a Question-Answering Transformer Model**\n",
    "3. Extracting and Categorizing Wage Figures Using Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook shows the second step process - finetuning a transformer using labeled data. The findings and analyses using the extracted wage data are available in the working paper [\"Pay Transparency and Gender Differences in Job Search\"](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4984519)."

    "## Step 1: Prepare the training set\n",
    "Job postings from LinkUp are typically lengthy, and over 90\\% of them do not contain any wage information. Processing these extensive texts without any filtration would be highly time- and resource-consuming. To streamline the finetuning process, I extracted text segments from job descriptions that contain a dollar sign followed by digits (e.g., $\\$$12, $\\$$9, $\\$$52,000). This targeted extraction focuses on sentences likely to include wage information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method may miss instances where wage information is presented without a dollar sign, such as \"salary range: 120000 - 160000.\" However, such cases are relatively rare and represent only a small fraction of the dataset.\n"
